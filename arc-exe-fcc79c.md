Arc.exe is an executable file associated with PeaZip, an open-source file archiver and compression software that enables users to create, manage, and extract compressed files in various formats. The version 6.9.2 of PeaZip, which Arc.exe is part of, is generally considered safe and does not exhibit characteristics of virus or malware, as it is developed by a reputable publisher committed to open-source principles. However, like any executable file, it can be falsely flagged by antivirus software, leading to potential errors or warnings during installation or execution. Users should ensure they download Arc.exe from the official PeaZip website to avoid encountering modified or malicious versions that could pose security risks. In some instances, users might experience errors related to missing dependencies or compatibility issues, particularly on older operating systems, which can be resolved through system updates or by reinstalling the application.
