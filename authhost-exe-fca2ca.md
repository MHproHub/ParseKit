AuthHost.exe is a legitimate Windows system file developed by Microsoft, specifically associated with the Windows operating system version 10.0.15063.0. It serves as an authentication host process, playing a crucial role in managing user authentication and ensuring secure access to various services and applications. Generally considered safe, AuthHost.exe is not a virus or malware; however, users may occasionally encounter errors related to this file, which can manifest as system instability or application failures. If AuthHost.exe is located in its designated system folder (C:\Windows\System32), it is likely to be the genuine file, but if found elsewhere, it may indicate a potential security threat. As with any system file, it's important to keep the operating system updated and to run regular antivirus scans to mitigate any risks associated with malware that might impersonate legitimate processes.
